# rot13

`rot13` reads from standard input or the named files,
moving each occurrence of a letter 13 places forward in the alphabet,
wrapping around past the end of the alphabet See also [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13).

I wrote it partly for fun
and partly because I didn't want all the setgid stuff in [bsdgames](https://packages.debian.org/bsdgames) appearing in my security reports.
